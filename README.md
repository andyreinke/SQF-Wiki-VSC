SQF-Wiki is an extension that allows users to easily look up commands on the BI wiki.

## Features

Just highlight the command you'd like to lookup and right click or press the hotkey ctrl+shift+q
Updated 2020, you can now just right click on a function. No need to highlight the text anymore!

## Works with SQF Language


**Have fun!**
